# ADD - Atributte Driven Design - Resume

## What is ADD?

ADD is a method for designing software architecture that is based on the use of attributes to drive the design process. The method is based on the idea that the attributes of a system are the most important factors that should be considered when designing the architecture of the system. By using attributes to drive the design process, architects can ensure that the resulting architecture meets the needs of the system and its stakeholders.

## Why you should use ADD?  

ADD is a way to create a software architecture that is based on the attributes of the system. By using attributes to drive the design process, architects can ensure that the resulting architecture meets the needs of the system and its stakeholders. This can help to ensure that the resulting architecture is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
